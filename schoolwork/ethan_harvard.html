	<h2>Some fun facts about Harvard</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Harvard holds real estate totalling 5,457 acres of land, the size of over 4000 football fields! But it hasn’t always been this large. Classes at Harvard began in the summer of 1638 in a single frame house and a college yard. Of the total land owned, the main university campus holds only about 4%.</li>
		
		<li>With all that land, there has got to be a couple of libraries, right? Harvard has some of the world’s most famous university libraries that boasts a collection that is the oldest in America. There are 79 libraries, the main and largest one is known as the Widener Memorial Library. It houses about 3.5 million works in over 100 languages, and 92 kilometres of shelves across ten levels. Four of the floors are underground because they needed to expand and could not go anywhere but down.</li>
		
		<li>Back in 2012, about 125 students got caught cheating on a govnment class exam. Most of the students caught were made to withdraw from the university. Yale the arch nemesis of Harvard came up with a brilliant and humorous shirt to wear during the Harvard-Yale football game, it read "Try cheating your way out of this one" Talk about harsh!</li>
		
		<li>Here’s a fact that we can expect from Harvard. We all know that the process of getting into Harvard University is super rigorous and unbelievably hard. But did you know that the selection rate is just 4.6%? Meaning that for every 100 applications that Harvard receives yearly, around 95 are tossed out.</li>
		
		<li> Harvards mascot John Harvard, the Pilgrim, was named after a puritan minister who arrived in the United States in 1637, who also died the following year, before the minister died he gave the school an endowment. Since the Harvard mascot is a unique case because its name is the university, which is why in some cases the color crimson is used in its stead.</li>
		
		<li> Harvard was founded by John Harvard on, September 8, 1636, in Cambridge, MA.
